<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Dr. Henke is a coastal engineer with expertise in modeling ocean surface waves and hydrodynamics as they relate to coastal processes, flood hazards, and marine energy. His previous research at the GMU [Flood Hazards Research Lab](https://fhrl.vse.gmu.edu/) spans from studying wave-ice interaction along the Alaskan Arctic coast to analyzing marsh migration within the estuaries of the mid-Atlantic. Presently at the Pacific Northwest National Lab's [Ocean Dynamics and Modeling group](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/ocean-dynamics-modeling), his work is concentrated on numerical modeling of tides and waves in high-latitude and Arctic environments to advance understanding of wave-current-ice interaction and assess marine energy potentials in Alaska.
